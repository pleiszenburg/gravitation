Getting Help
============

There are multiple ways of getting help.

Reporting Bugs / Issues
-----------------------

Bugs and any kind of issues should be reported in the project's `Github issue tracker`_, also see :ref:`chapter on bugs <bugs>`.

.. _Github issue tracker: https://github.com/pleiszenburg/gravitation/issues

Paid Support
------------

In addition to the previous options, paid support is available from `pleiszenburg.de - Independent Scientific Services`_.

The code base is designed in a generic way and can serve as a foundation for similar analyses of problems other than n-body-simulations.
